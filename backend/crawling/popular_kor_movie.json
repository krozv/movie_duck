Mom, reluctant to leave Guro-dong that she’d been living in for 20 years and her marriage life, will she be able to find herself and move out well?",

People who come are diverse, including women in their late 30s, Japanese, and middle-aged men. At night, visitors call the museum and make excuses for their deaths.
